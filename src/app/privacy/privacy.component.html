<h1>Privacy Policy for Apps</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Apps developed and published by <strong>Maikel Stuivenberg</strong>, including <strong>Encore, Bravo, Qwixx</strong>. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our Apps.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We only collect <strong>non-personally identifiable information (non-PII)</strong>, as described below:</p>

<p><strong>a. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (non-PII)</strong><br>
Our apps may collect non-PII, such as device type, operating system, IP address, usage statistics, and other technical data. This data helps us improve app performance and enhance your user experience.</p>

<p><strong>b. Crash and Performance Data</strong><br>
We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app performance, detect bugs, and understand app usage. These tools automatically collect device-specific information, events, and diagnostic data in the event of crashes or app failures. This data helps us troubleshoot issues and improve app stability.</p>

<p><strong>c. Firebase Analytics</strong><br>
Firebase Analytics tracks non-PII such as app usage trends, user interactions, and app performance metrics. This information is aggregated and anonymous, helping us optimize the user experience.</p>

<p><strong>d. Google AdMob</strong><br>
Our apps may display optional ads using Google AdMob. The Google Mobile Ads SDK automatically collects the following data for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IP address:</strong> Collected to estimate the general location of the device.</li>
  <li><strong>User product interactions:</strong> Includes app launch, taps, and video views.</li>
  <li><strong>Diagnostic information:</strong> Includes crash logs, app launch times, hang rates, and energy usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Device and Account identifiers:</strong> Collects Android advertising ID, app set ID, and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>All user data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p><strong>Improving App Performance</strong>: We use crash logs, analytics data, and other non-PII to improve app performance, user interface, and functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing User Experience</strong>: The insights from Firebase Analytics help us to better understand how users interact with our apps and where we can improve the user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting & Debugging</strong>: Crash reports help us identify and resolve bugs or other issues that might negatively impact your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong>: Google AdMob helps us display optional ads to fund the development and maintenance of our apps.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell your information. However, we may share non-PII with third-party service providers (such as Google Firebase and Google AdMob) who help us analyze app performance, display ads, and troubleshoot issues. These providers are obligated to use your data solely for the purposes of providing these services.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not directly retain any non-PII. Data collected by Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, and Google AdMob may be retained by Google. You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We make efforts to securely transmit non-PII to Google services using industry-standard encryption methods, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, as the data is ultimately processed and stored by Google, we encourage users to review Google’s privacy policies for more information about how they safeguard and retain data.</p>

<h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
<p>You cannot disable data collection for Google Analytics, Crashlytics, or AdMob through app settings. To completely stop the collection of any data, you will need to uninstall the app.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to see personalized ads from Google AdMob, you can adjust your ad preferences in your Google account settings or uninstall the app to stop seeing ads altogether.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our apps are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us to remove it.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review it periodically. Continued use of our apps constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
